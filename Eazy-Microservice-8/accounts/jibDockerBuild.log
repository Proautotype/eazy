* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring root project 'accounts'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':classpath'.
   > Could not resolve org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.3.0.
     Required by:
         project : > org.springframework.boot:org.springframework.boot.gradle.plugin:3.3.0
      > No matching variant of org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:3.3.0 was found. The consumer was configured to find a library for use during runtime, compatible with Java 8, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '8.7' but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component for use during compile-time, compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component for use during runtime, compatible with Java 8
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '8.7')
          - Variant 'javadocElements' declares a component for use during runtime, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares documentation and the consumer needed a library
              - Other compatible attributes:
                  - Doesn't say anything about its elements (required them packaged as a jar)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 8)
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '8.7')
          - Variant 'mavenOptionalApiElements' declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component for use during compile-time, compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component for use during runtime, compatible with Java 8

                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '8.7')

                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '8.7')
          - Variant 'modernGradleRuntimeElements' declares a library for use during runtime, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '8.7':
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component, compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component, compatible with Java 8
          - Variant 'runtimeElements' declares a library for use during runtime, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '7.5':
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component, compatible with Java 17 and the consumer needed a component, compatible with Java 8
          - Variant 'sourcesElements' declares a component for use during runtime, and its dependencies declared externally:
